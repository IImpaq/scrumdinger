#  Scrumdinger


## Description

This repository contains all the code for the Scrumdinger app. This app was developed as part of the iOS App Dev Tutorials.
The reason for working my way through the tutorial series is to get started with modern apps for iOS.
By finishing this application I was able to learn Swift as well as SwiftUI and getting myself familiar with provided features such as "speech to text".
